I want to start this presentation with gratitude because although starting my PhD in a pandemic and only being at Concordia for a year and 4 months, I have so many people to thank. HUGE thank you to the ZULE lab, they are in every single part of this proposal. Shout out to Kayleigh, who I think has read this more than anyone else but also Lingshan, Fatemeh, Emily, Katie, Nicole, Gail, Maya, Noa, Mathieu, and Serena for the endless edits. Thank you to Nicole and Lauren for helping me collect and clean data! Special thank you to Michael for edits as well as collaboration on the second chapter, and OF COURSE a huge thank you to Carly who has been a truly excellent supervisor. I also want to thank my committee and examiners for spending time thinking about my project, that is extremely cool for me to have so many smart people think about my work and how to make it better. And finally, after all this gratitude I do want to acknowledge that I am doing this work on the stolen land of many Indigenous peoples including the Haudenosaunee, Mohawk, and Anishinaabeg peoples. I use this land acknowledgement not as a final destination or a checkmark on a list but as a constant reminder to engage with and grapple with how my science as a settler on this land is or is not reckoning with colonization and its ongoing presence.

Okay so we are going to start with a little intro into some of the main concepts that underpin my proposal. First, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the urban ecosystem.  Traditionally, we have thought of ecosystems in ecology as the existence and interactions between biotic and physical elements - as we see here

However, we can conceptualize the difference between "traditional" ecosystems and urban ecosystems through the additions of two types of elements - built and social. Built being infrastructure that humans create such as roads and buildings, and social being the inherent social structures and interactions that occur between humans.

An important part of the biotic elements in cities is the urban forest. We can think of the urban forest as all trees, shrubs, and greenspaces within an urban area and it is part of the biotic elements found within cities. The urban forest is critical to human well-being and different components of the urban forest function extremely differently. For example, we can imagine the forest remnant pictured on the far left providing really different ecosystem functions than a managed park or a green roof, on the right. A remnant forest may provide better habitat for wildlife and support more native species. Whereas a managed park may provide more mental health benefits and a green roof may add green space to an extremely dense environment. However, they can also all decrease air temperatures and store carbon, although albeit with different capacities.

Now, when we discuss all the benefits that we receive from the urban forest (and other biotic elements within our cities), we often refer to the benefits as "ecosystem services".  In my thesis, and proposal, I really focus exclusively on ecosystem service capacity - which is the total potential of an ecosystem to produce a service. However, factors such as pressure and demand inherently influence both capacity, and importantly, flow of ecosystem services. 

We can use this diagram to imagine a system where demand for ecosystem services is kept constant through time. However, we see a pressure, a physical stressors acting on an ecosystem such as a storm increasing, which subsequently causes a decrease in the capacity perhaps due to tree death/removal. This example demonstrates that each part of the ecosystem services framework is really imprtant to understand if we want to understand the actual flow and delivery of ES. However, its also really complex and in my thesis I have chosen to focus on specifically capacity because it underlines it all - because with no capacity there can be no provision

???

Importantly, when we conceptualize ecosystem services provided by the urban forest, we have to understand that these biotic elements are inherently intertwined with the physical, built, and social elements of our cities as well. Thus, we can understand that the inequity built into the social elements of our cities underpins the built, natural, and physical elements as well, including the urban forest. And indeed if we **don't** try to incorporate inequities into our science, we will never be ably to fully understand our ecosystems. For example, urban greenspaces and parks provide many benefits to urban residents, including improving mental health, providing a sense of community, reducing temperatures, and during covid providing a safe space t socialize. However, overall park area as well as park quality decreases as you increase the proportion of racialized people within a neighbourhood. This is important of course if we are interested in inequity and environmental justice. But it is also key to understanding the distribution and composition of the urban forest. Without understanding and incorporating the piece of inequity, I as a scientist would never be able to fully understand this ecosystem.

And so if we conceptualize inequity as varying across space we can start to imagine spatial heterogeneity. Now, of course, there are other factors that are causing spatial heterogeneity - going back to the physical, biotic, and built elements all intertwined. All of these complex layers work together to create cities which are a uniquely fine-scale spatially heterogeneous system. And this spatial heterogeneity occurs on many scales - we can see on this slide that land surface temperature varies on a fine-scale, along a single street for example - but it also varies across neighbourhoods, and we can of course imagine it varying across cities. Spatial heterogeneity is so important when considering our cities

Similarly important to spatial heterogeneity is temporal heterogeneity! We know that current functioning of our cities with respect to ecosystem services and other ecological processes is temporally heterogeneous, and specifically are influenced by legacy effects which are a form of temporal heterogeneity. Legacy effects occur when an event carries its effects across time.  

This figure shows us how historical land use cover surrounding parks often can contribute to our understanding of the current ecological functioning and composition of the park. Black circles represent AIC values of models that have carbon storage, bird density etc. as the response and land use cover as explanatory variables across several decades/centuries. What we see, is that for a few of these models, historical land use cover actually better explains the relationship with current day park composition than current land use cover surrounding the park. These influences of past land uses on today's park functioning are a good example of the importance of legacy effects.

Alright so now we are getting into the actual proposed research in my proposal, as you probably already know I have three chapters proposed. The first taking a kind of zoomed out, spatial approach to ecosystem services. The second diving into the more temporal/legacy effects aspect of the urban forest and ecosystem services in parks. And then the third chapter looking at legacy effects of urban form decisions and the ongoing process of gentrification and how those two things interact to impact the urban forest in Montreal neighbourhoods.

# .small[Chapter 1: Cross-City Drivers of Ecosystem Services]

This chapter is driven by the question - what are the cross-city drivers of regulatory ecosystem service capacity provided by the urban forest in Canadian temperate cities? And I think this is an interesting question because although there has undoubtedly been a lot of work regarding ecosystem services in urban settings - there hasn't been many studies that try to take this multi-city, multi-scale approach. And I think it is an interesting approach to take because if there are indeed factors, or drivers, that consistently influence ecosystem service capacity - regardless of scale or city - we can use that knowledge to more effectively plan and manage for ecosystem services.

class: chapterone

# .small[Chapter 1: Cross-City Drivers of Ecosystem Services]

**Hypotheses** 

--

*Cross-City Drivers*: We hypothesize that there will be some drivers that influence ecosystem service capacity in the same direction across scales/cities. For example:  

- tree size .large[`r emo::ji("deciduous_tree")`].small[`r emo::ji("deciduous_tree")`]
- tree density .large[`r emo::ji("house_with_garden")` `r emo::ji("office_building")`]
- impervious surface .large[`r emo::ji("bricks")`] 

--

*City-Specific Drivers*: We hypothesize that there will be some drivers that change magnitude and direction in how they influence ecosystem service capacity across scales/cities. For example: 

- tree diversity .large[`r emo::ji("deciduous_tree")``r emo::ji("palm_tree")``r emo::ji("evergreen_tree")`]
- building function .large[`r emo::ji("house_with_garden")` `r emo::ji("office_building")`]
- class/income .large[`r emo::ji("bill")`]

???

This chapter's hypotheses are really driven by this kind of cross-city vs city-specific framework, with the idea that there will be some drivers, for example tree size, tree density, or impervious surfaces, that consistently influence ecosystem services. So bigger trees mitigate higher temperatures and store more carbon, regardless of what city you are in or what scale you look at. However, it should be noted that I do not expect the magnitude of the effect to stay the same, just direction. In contrast, we also expect to have some city or scale-specific drivers. These are factors, potentially such as tree diversity, building function, or median income, that may influence ecosystem service capacity differently depending on the scale or city you are looking at. We might imagine that a more species rich forest might increase capacity to store carbon at a city scale but not a street scale, or that different cities may have different approaches to tree planting across different building functions - e.g., commercial lots look different in Toronto than Halifax.

So with all that in mind, my first chapter will take a multi-scale, multi-service, multi-city approach to this question. Using seven cities across Canada and three scales - street, neighbourhood, and whole city, we will test if there are cross-city drivers.

The conceptualization of the analysis for this chapter gets a little bit complicated when you try to hold it all in your brain at once. And I am super open to a discussion regarding this, I would love to get everyone's opinions and insights. On this slide, I am presenting one possible approach that I have started to think about. Basically here, I am depicting some hypothetical cross-city drivers (x axis), at the neighbourhood scale, for all three ecosystem service capacities (y axis), for three hypothetical cities. Here, I have the response variables separated obviously, but I would also be looking at the interaction between these three ecosystem service capacities through a kind of spatial hotspot analysis. I have also considered using a multiple linear regression with all three response variables included in the same model so that we can see the interactions between them, since they are of course related and causally tied to one another. We could also imagine this graph with only one driver and each column being a different scale, street vs neighbourhood vs city. Basically, modelling the variables and trying to tease out these common relationships is the goal. But I haven't nailed down exactly the approach I will be taking.

Moving on to chapter 2 - where we start to dial in more on the temporal heterogeneity and the influence of historical events. The question driving this chapter is first, what are the legacy effects of past land-use types on our current ecosystem services in Montreal parks. And second - how are these different past land uses represented in today's neighbourhoods - for example - is there overrepresentation of industrial land use types in areas that have a high percentage of immigrants or visible minorities?

---

class: chaptertwo
# .small[Chapter 2: Legacy Effects of Past Land-Use]

**Hypotheses**  

--

1) Previous land-use type will influence urban forest composition and ecosystem service capacity in today's parks according to levels of disturbance, where:  
  - <span style="color:#43b284; font-weight: 700">Forested</span> parks will have the largest trees and highest ecosystem service capacity
  - <span style = "color:#c88a2c; font-weight: 700">Agricultural</span> parks will have the second largest trees and ecosystem service capacity 
  - <span style = "color:#dd5129; font-weight: 700">Industrial</span> parks will have the smallest trees and lowest ecosystem service capacity  

--

2) Neighbourhoods surrounding our <span style = "color:#dd5129; font-weight: 700">industrial</span> parks will have been historically inhabited by marginalized people. However, this relationship will have shifted over time in Montreal, leading to a weaker relationship with neighbourhood sociodemographics today


???

Our hypotheses for this chapter first address how previous land-use types influence our parks today. We hypothesize that land use types that ultimately resulted in an input of nutrients - i.e., agricultural and previously forested (or natural) will result in parks that today have denser, larger trees and a higher ecosystem service capacity. Whereas, we expect that land use types that contaminated the soil - here labelled as industrial, which includes both previous quarries and previous landfills, will have smaller trees and lower ecosystem service capacity today.

To address this question, we are going to sample 30 parks total - 10 for each land cover class type across the island of Montreal.

Within the parks, we will split the park into areas of low, medium, and high canopy cover and do 3 sampling plots per cover level. The plots are based on iTree sampling methodology, a popular approach in urban ecology and will be 0.04 ha in size. In each plot, we will do a forest inventory including species and size of trees, as well as place a temperature sensor so we can assess the temperature mitigation capacity of these parks. We will also do an overall assessment of total canopy cover, to get a more holistic picture of the park as well.

I anticipate using generalized linear models to tease out the relationships between past land use type and current ecosystem service capacity/forest composition.

Finally, chapter three continues in the temporal heterogeneity vein and will try to address the trade-offs or tensions between historical urban form decisions and the process of gentrification, and how these things influence the urban forest of today's neighbourhoods in Montreal. The idea here being that there are historical urban form decisions that can be considered "static" - in that they are extremely hard to change and often do not change, even when a neighbourhood is developed and redeveloped. And even when a neighbourhood goes through a developmental process, in the case of this chapter - gentrification, these static factors may constrain the effect that gentrification has on our urban forest, which may diminish or change the effects that we might expect to see.

One of the main ways that gentrification relates and changes the urban forest is through what is known as the luxury effect. The luxury effect refers to the positive relationship between wealth and whiteness, with respect to urban forest size, diversity, and resilience. The luxury effect has been studied worldwide but has the most evidence supporting it in the United States. This figure shows the relationship between income inequity and the urban forest across many different studies, where studies on the right hand side of the middle line provided evidence for the link between inequity and the urban forest (with varying mechanisms and measures)

This figure is a review by the same authors showing the relationship between race inequity and the urban forest.

One hypothesis for the noisy, complex relationship between environmental injustice in Canadian cities, specifically with respect to gentrification, is the interacting effects with urban form. Urban form refers to the physical configuration of an urban area and refers to factors such as building density, building setback, road size, and others. There has been some really excellent work done in the city of Montreal that shows that urban form is a major contributing factor to, at the very least, canopy cover composition in the city, with urban form variables interacting with socioeconomic variables to significantly determine levels of canopy cover.

**Hypotheses** There is tension between *static* and *dynamic* urban form factors, which influences how gentrification influences the urban forest community in current Montreal neighbourhoods 

```{r, echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tension.png")
```

???

So we hypothesize that these static urban form factors, such as road size and building setback, are constraining the effect that the dynamic factors, which change through gentrification has on the urban forest. So although gentrification will change the urban forest - perhaps through increasing diversity or density of trees, it will only change SO much in areas that are constrained by really low building setback and high population density.

**Approach**

- 15 sites total, 3 classes of gentrification, continuous gradient of urban form

```{r, echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("ch3sampling.png")
```


???

To try and tease out how all these factors are operating together, we will use a categorical approach to gentrification, developed by Statistics Canada and designate 5 neighbourhoods as either gentrified, not gentrified, or didn't qualify for gentrification. We will then spread those 5 sites across

**Proposed Analysis**
```{r, eval = T, echo = F, warning = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.retina = 2}
rho4 <- -0.4

NAGenD  <- (rho4 * density) + sqrt(1 - rho4*rho4) * rnorm(n = N, mean = 6, sd = 1)
GenD <- (rho4 * density) + sqrt(1 - rho4*rho4) * rnorm(n = N, mean = 10, sd = 1)
DNGenD  <- (rho4 * density) + sqrt(1 - rho4*rho4) * rnorm(n = N, mean = 3, sd = 1)

df3.2 <- as.data.table(cbind(density, NAGenD, GenD, DNGenD))

df3.2l <- melt(df3.2, id.vars = "density", measure.vars = c("NAGenD", "GenD", "DNGenD"), value.name = "ForestDiversity", variable.name = "NeighbourhoodType")
ggplot(df3.2l, aes(x = density, y = ForestDiversity, colour = NeighbourhoodType)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#FEEFD8", "#FDCFA8", "#EB806F"), labels = c("Non Gentrifiable", "Gentrified", "Did Not Gentrify")) +

        plot.background = element_rect(fill='#e7e5cc', color=NA), 
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = '#e7e5cc'))  

```

Finally, I expect to model these results using a continuous gradient of density based on a variety of urban form factors. I will use dependent variables of urban forest size, density, and diversity for street trees, as well as overall canopy cover to try and capture the contribution of privately owned trees in my analysis.

**Scale vs City** 

- Landscape vs local level effects 

- Drivers that vary across scales but consistently across cities 
  - e.g., air pollution mitigation + tree size
  - e.g., temperature mitigation + building height 

- Drivers that vary across cities but consistently across scales 
  - e.g., sociodemographic variables - effect often scales up but is dependent on local context

**Gentrification**

"Gentrification is an area-level process in which formerly declining, under-resourced neighbourhoods experience reinvestment and in-migration of increasingly affluent new residents"
